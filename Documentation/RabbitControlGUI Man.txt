Purpose: Testing TCP Commands for Rabbit control of AD9858 DDS

This tool presents a simple framework for adding and testing new TCP commands.

Instructions.

1.	Open TCP socket with Rabbit using Connect button.
2. 	Flashing Heartbeat and solid green Connection Indicator indicate good link.
3.	Enter Decimal Value of command into CMD Numeric.
4.	CMD parameters passed to RabbitCom9858 functions from data1-date3 numerics.
	See RabbitControlGUI Protocol Guide.xls for list of CMD values and reqd numeric 
	entries for each command. 

TroubleShooting.

-	Ensure Rabbit IP and Port are entered correctly in source. (That is they 
	correspond to the scoket being opened by the Rabbit).

-	Ensure Static IP is within an acceptable range for your LAN and is not being 
	used by another machine.

-	Ensure DDS Core is powered up CMD 160:1. It is powered down by default.
